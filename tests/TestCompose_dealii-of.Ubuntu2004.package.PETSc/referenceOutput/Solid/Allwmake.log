Building the OpenFOAM adapter for preCICE...

Current OpenFOAM environment:
  WM_PROJECT = OpenFOAM
  WM_PROJECT_VERSION = v2006

The adapter will be built into:
  ADAPTER_TARGET_DIR    = /home/precice/OpenFOAM/root-v2006/platforms/linux64GccDPInt32Opt/lib

The following building options will be used:
  ADAPTER_PREP_FLAGS    = -DADAPTER_DEBUG_MODE
  ADAPTER_WMAKE_OPTIONS = 

Dependencies (preCICE) will be located using the following environment variables:
  ADAPTER_PRECICE_ROOT  = /home/precice/precice
      preCICE dependencies: not specified (ok if preCICE is built as a shared library)
  ADAPTER_PKG_CONFIG_CFLAGS       = 
  ADAPTER_PKG_CONFIG_LIBS         = -lprecice
  ADAPTER_GLOBAL_CPLUS_INC_PATHS  = -I/usr/include/eigen3 
  ADAPTER_GLOBAL_LD_LIBRARY_PATHS = -L/usr/lib/openfoam/openfoam2006/platforms/linux64GccDPInt32Opt/lib/openmpi-system -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openmpi/lib -L/home/precice/OpenFOAM/root-v2006/platforms/linux64GccDPInt32Opt/lib -L/usr/lib/openfoam/openfoam2006/site/2006/platforms/linux64GccDPInt32Opt/lib -L/usr/lib/openfoam/openfoam2006/platforms/linux64GccDPInt32Opt/lib -L/usr/lib/openfoam/openfoam2006/platforms/linux64GccDPInt32Opt/lib/dummy 
  ADAPTER_GLOBAL_LIBRARY_PATHS    = 

Building with WMake (see the wmake.log log file)...

=== OK: Building completed successfully! ===
Next step: Run an example from the tutorials/ directory.
